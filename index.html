I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.
 
--REFLECTION--
This assignment challenged me a lot. I spent a lot of time learning about
and understanding the JavaScript and what it's doing. The syntax that is used on
the websites is much more condensed than I am used to.

As inspiration, I thought I would make a fake website for a youtube channel that
my dad has been wanting to make. It gave me a lot of ideas for a color pallete and
and artwork.

--EXTRA ITEMS COMPLETED--
Use fontawesome Icons (2pts)  YES (the bars when nav is squished)
