<PROJECT 5 Reflection> 
I had to change a lot to get this project working after a lot of bugs that I didn't see in the
last update. I can see more mistakes when refactoring now which means I learned something in this
semester ;). The theme version sidebar was a pain when in mobile so I switched it to overhead when
smaller.
